# country-region-data 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/country-regions/country-region-data.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/country-regions/country-region-data)

This repo provides country and region data in three different formats: es6, UMD (Unified Module Definition) and
plain JSON. The data contains country names, country short codes, country regions, and country region short 
codes. All country names and short codes are guaranteed to be unique. Similarly, all regions and region short
codes *within a single country* are guaranteed to be unique.

I created this repo to house the raw data used for the [country-region-selector](https://github.com/country-regions/country-region-selector),
[react-country-region-selector](https://github.com/country-regions/react-country-region-selector) scripts. I didn't want to 
duplicate it in multiple places and hey, it seemed like this could be useful as a standalone repo.

### Install

This package is available as an npm package. You can install via npm or yarn:

```
npm install country-region-data
yarn add country-region-data
```

### Structure

See the `data.json` file in the root folder for the raw data. The JSON is of the form:

```javascript
[
  {
    "countryName":"Ecuador",
    "countryShortCode":"EC",
    "regions":[
      {
        "name":"Azuay",
        "shortCode":"A"
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  ... 
]
```

The `data.json` file is the source of truth for the data set, but the generated build artifacts (not seen the repo -
only in the npm package) are:

```
dist/data.js
dist/data-umd.js
```

The first one is an es6 file containing all the data in tree-shakeable format; the second is an UMD file containing the 
entire content. Up until v2 of this repo, UMD was the default. Now the es6 export is the default and the typings reflects
the content of that file, not UMD.

### How to use

The es6 file can be imported like so:

```jsx harmony
import { allCountries } from 'country-region-data';
```

If you're using typescript you'll get all the typings and see the structure of the exported data in your IDE. If not, 
check your node_modules/country-region-data/dist folder and look at the `data.d.ts` file to get the full list of exported 
information.

The UMD file can be used like this:

```jsx harmony
import countryRegionData from 'country-region-data/dist/data-umd';
```

The raw JSON like this:

```jsx harmony
import json from 'country-region-data/data.json';
```

### Typings 

So this bit I'm not sure about... so ping me if I'm wrong or if there's a better way to do it. There are three
different formats for the repo data: JSON, UMD and ES6. I figure es6 is going to be the most likely used format, so the
generated typings file (data.d.ts) is referenced in the "typings" property in the package.json file and should be picked 
up by your IDEs. 

There are no typings for the UMD or JSON format. 


### Contribute

Make your changes to the `data.json` file.

Updates and fixes to the data is much appreciated! The state/prov abbreviations in particular are not yet complete, so
the more contributors the better. Regions that need ISO3166-2 codes can be identified by having a missing `shortCode` 
property for each region. You can find them by cloning the repo, then running:

```
yarn install
npx grunt findIncomplete
```

That'll list all countries with regions that are missing region short codes. Wikipedia has a lot of the data listed here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2
 

### Data Validation

Before contributing a PR, please validate the JSON content (if you don't, Travis will catch it for you!). To do that, 
run the following on your command line:

```
yarn install
npx grunt validate
```

That'll throw an error if the JSON is invalid or if some duplicate names were accidentally introduced. The error messages 
are pretty clear, I think.


### Changelog

Note that this repo does _not_ use semantic versioning. I realize that's pretty non-standard, but every change
to this repo is a dataset change which is technically backward incompatible. So although we could be bumping
the major version with each release, I think that that would be more problematic: apps can no longer use the `~` and 
`^` chars in their package.json files to get the latest content so updates would be manual and frequent. If people
disagree about this let me know.
