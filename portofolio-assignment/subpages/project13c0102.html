            <h2>About the project</h2>
            <p>In this project, we worked with colors, contrast and light/dark mode for users</p>

            <h2>My solution</h2>
            <p>For my solution i wanted to use just simple light & dark colors, with three accent colours, but i realized i needed some more for the darkmode function to work</p>
            <p>
              The issue arised when i wantend to switch to dark mode, and i had no option to make the the whit bakcground be darker withour just getting a complete dark site.<br />
              By adding two extra colors (a darker light colour and a lighter dark colour) I could implement the darkmode
            </p>
            <p>The accent colors worked well witht the darker colors, but not the lighter. So even though the contrast wasn't great, I just made sure i used the best one on the lighter areas.</p>
